Thank you for your interest in the Functional Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (FMRI) Research Program at the Medical College of Wisconsin.
The fMRI Research Program is a web-based database/registry, which
contains information about study participants and conducted fMRI
sessions. You are invited to participate in a research study, which
involves your submission of identifiable personal information to be
entered in the fMRI research database/registry. It will take 15 minutes
to complete the enrollment form. Your participation in this study is
voluntary. The database/registry is operated under the direction of
Stephen Rao, Ph.D., who is a faculty member of the Medical College of
Wisconsin. The information contained in the database/registry is used
for several purposes: to identify candidates for future fMRI research
and to ensure that the reported data is accurate and matches the fMRI
scans. <br>
<br>
Your consent to participate is identified in two ways:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">1. Submission of a completed enrollment
form.&nbsp; Completion of the enrollment form may occur in 15 minutes.
Your personal information, which includes health information, is
requested in the enrollment form.&nbsp; This information will then be
entered into the fMRI database/registry, which will provide information
to upcoming research studies. fMRI scanning sessions are conducted for
research purposes only.&nbsp; Your personal information will be kept in
the database/registry until 2026. <br>
<br>
2. Participation in fMRI scanning sessions.&nbsp; Based upon the
information provided in the enrollment form and entered in the
database/registry, you will be considered for fMRI scanning session(s)
in the future. You may be contacted by a member of a research team
conducting the fMRI scanning session to ask you to participate in the
fMRI scanning session.&nbsp; Each fMRI scanning session is research and
you must give your consent to participate before engaging in any
research related activities.&nbsp; Information about your participation
in the fMRI scanning session will also be included in the fMRI
database/registry.<br>
</div>
<br>
The risk associated with providing your personal information for use in
this database/registry is the potential for breach of confidentiality,
(someone learning of private information about you without your
permission).&nbsp; Your personal information is kept in a
database/registry, which is password-protected.&nbsp; The data is
protected by allowing only the database administrator direct access to
the database/registry while allowing a limited number of individuals
viewing access.&nbsp; In the event of a security breach, the
database/registry will be immediately shut down and the cause of the
breach will be investigated. All access to the database/registry is
logged and it should be possible to identify the cause and the extent
of the breach based on those records.<br>
<br>
There is no known benefit for you to participate in this study; however
there may be some benefit to society resulting from future research
studies. <br>
<br>
If you do not want your personal information to be banked in the
database registry until 2026, please do not submit your information.<br>
<br>
Your participation in the research study is voluntary and you may
discontinue your participation at any time.&nbsp; If you wish to
withdraw your participation in future studies, you can notify the study
coordinator through electronic mail or telephone. Upon notification,
all identifiable information such as name, address, phone number, and
electronic mail address will be removed from the database/registry. If
you decide to withdraw from the study, your decision will have no
impact on the quality of current or future medical care you receive,
academic standing, or job status. <br>
<br>
If you have any further questions or require additional information,
feel free to contact our study coordinator at (414)456-4614.&nbsp; If
you have any questions regarding your rights or responsibilities as a
research participant, please contact the Medical College of Wisconsin
Human Research Protection Office Quality Assurance and Compliance
Coordinator at 414-456-8844.<br>

you to submit personal information, including health information, which
will be kept strictly confidential and available only to research
personnel with security clearance.<br>
