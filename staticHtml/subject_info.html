   <p>Thank you for your interest in the Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (FMRI) Research Program at the Medical College of Wisconsin. This is an ongoing, joint neuroscience project involving researchers from several departments of the Medical College. FMRI is a process by which images of the brain are obtained while the participant is engaged in some task. The method is "functional" in that the images show which areas of the brain are "working" the hardest during various tasks. This is in contrast to standard MRI scans, which produce images of the brain's shape and appearance.</p>

   <p>Both types of MRI scanning use radio waves and a strong magnetic field to create the images. There is no radiation or injected dyes involved, and no known risks when FDA guidelines are followed. MRI has been used in animal research since the 1940's and has had widespread clinical application in since 1980. Investigators at the Medical College are using the FMRI technique to study vision, hearing, language, motor function, memory, and other complex brain functions.</p>

   <p>The FMRI procedure involves lying in a tube-shaped machine while performing various mental and motor tasks. It is painless, although it is noisy and requires the participant to remain still for an extended period of time. The participant wears a helmet-like device that encases the FMRI magnetic coil. There is an intercom system in the scanner through which participants can be heard at all times, and the technicians in the adjacent control room use the intercom to inform participants each time a series of scans is about to begin. One cautionary  note: the "tube" is somewhat narrow, and although it is open on both ends, some people do have a claustrophobic reaction to the scanner. Anyone who is aware of feeling uncomfortable in close quarters should not volunteer for this study. The scan takes about 1 to 1.5 hours. Total participation time, which includes filling out information forms and practicing the tasks to be performed, is typically 2 to 3 hours.</p>

    <p>Payment for participation is $12.00 per hour, and participants may receive a print or digital picture of their brain upon request. If you are interested in participating, please read the Consent Form referenced below. This process requires you to submit personal information, including health information, which will be kept strictly confidential and available only to research personnel with security clearance.
